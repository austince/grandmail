Straight from the source:

Hi sweetie:
*
It's Monday morning and I'm back to work.  I even got to bed by 
11:00 p.m. last night.  No Golden Girls.  (tonight).
So how does it feel to be home?  I miss you both bunches.  
I keep thinking of all the things I forgot to do with you girls and the
 food I forgot to serve.  I found a whole bag of apples that I planned 
 to cut up for a nosh.  Oh well...... next time.   
I Love you bunches....enjoy the days ahead.....you'll especially enjoy 
when the boxes come.  
Bubbie
